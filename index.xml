      <title>blacklisting mbeans from Cassandra in jxm_exporter</title>

      <description>Why: There is a bug in Cassandra v3.0.14 that was preventing cleanup of sstables while tombstones were being polled. https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-13752
Supposedly, this is happening because the method that cleans them up and the method that reports the metrics step on eachother&amp;rsquo;s feet; getting metrics on tombstones interrups the cleanup and corrupts the table. It&amp;rsquo;s supposed to be fixed in 3.0.15 due next week, but disabling the polling of this mbean should stop the badness.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a 37yo DevOps/dev/sysadmin/dad/geek living in Bastrop, Texas which is about 45 minutes east of Downtown Austin where I&amp;rsquo;m the DevOps guy at a small startup that does social media analytics to help companies make sense of mountains of data. I have a lovely intellectual and feisty wife, an opinionated 2yo girl and a boy due any day now. I love exploring new technology, cooking, and DIY projects.
Some tech I either use daily or am interested in: python, scala, golang, docker, kubernetes, mesos, elasticsearch, cassandra, aerospike, postgres, macos, ios, machine learning, opencv, raspberry pi, networking, debian/ubuntu, coreos</description>

      <title>simple API call with go</title>

      <description>I like to familiarize myself with emerging and popular technologies so that when I come to a new problem I have more options in my bag of tricks to solve it as well as possible. Tools. I like tools.
Go is an increasingly popular language with a large dedicated following. Most of the new and amaze-balls infrastructure tech is written in go, including docker, etcd, prometheus, kubernetes. There are even tensorflow bindings and great distributed computing options.</description>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;ve probably heard of a thing called bitcoin. &amp;ldquo;It uses blockchain. It&amp;rsquo;s awesome!&amp;rdquo; Right? But what is it? Why should you use it? How can you get started?
Check out bitcoin.org/en and you&amp;rsquo;ll see a concise explanation: &amp;ldquo;Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority or banks; managing transactions and the issuing of bitcoins is carried out collectively by the network. Bitcoin is open-source; its design is public, nobody owns or controls Bitcoin and everyone can take part.</description>

      <title>encrypting text with gpg</title>

      <description>This post is a quick-start guide to using gpg to encrypt and decrypt text for messages via email, slack, or just about any medium. My gpg key is F930E099 at the end of this post. Read on for more details about how to use it!
If you&amp;rsquo;ve been paying attention to this year&amp;rsquo;s Presidential campaign, you&amp;rsquo;re probably aware of the impact that leaked emails can have on one&amp;rsquo;s public image. The thing that I&amp;rsquo;m surprised I haven&amp;rsquo;t heard anyone talking about is not whether it was a private email server or a government-secured server, but that any emails, not to mention classified material, are sent via unencrypted email.</description>
